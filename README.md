The World Builder's Tome, or simply, Tome, is a story-building tool that enables novel writers or rpg game masters to create and organize robust and complex fictional worlds.

Tome was created as a means of keeping track of the numerous elements involved in world and story creation. While there are many note taking systems out there, Tome sets out to provide a system specifically tailored to world creation.

## Status
Tome was initially created as a final project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive. It is still in progress, with plans to streamline and add additional features.

## Tech/framework
Tome utilizes a Ruby on Rails backend and JavaScript front end, with React and Redux. Styling utilizes Semantic UI React.


## Features
A user can create individual Worlds, inside of which they can create smaller stories, as well as characters and locations. Characters and locations can be tied to as many stories as the user likes. Each story is associated with notes where the real writing and planning can happen!
